# DevTools - Debugging

## What was the bug?
The bug was that the original program was concatenating strings instead of doing arithmetic operations on the numerical versions of the inputs.

## How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix.
To fix this, I added conversions from strings to numbers (floats because the user may use decimals) for both inputs so the result would be an arithmetic result.
